# My Other Repositories
This repository is just a place for me to store the images that I use in my other repositories.

**I have some pretty cool open-sourced projects in my repositories such as using:**
   - Google Cloud Platform 
   - Microsoft Azure (Face API)
   - Firebase
   - Kairos Face API
   - Weka Machine Learning Library
   
as well as some other projects.
